# GC-synthetic-experiments-data
These datasets were generated to assess linear and nonlinear Granger causalities in the submitted manuscript, Global Soil Moisture-Air Temperature Interactions from Linear and Nonlinear Granger Causalities by Bhatti et al. submitted to AGU-GRL

Nonlinear GC here is achieved with the Kernel Granger causality by Marinazzo et al. (2008). The data was used to develop theoretical experiments that help validate the strengths and limitations of both the linear Granger causality and the Kernel Granger causality before applying to real world datasets
